			<b>Artifact of Dissimilarity</b><br>
			Artifact of Dissonance but for interactables.<br>
			Will generate a random set of options based on a list of all interactables.<br>
			<br>
			Most interactable rarities stay the same, but that may change depending on what options are chosen.<br>
			* (Like if no Small Chest is chosen lots of other ones would spawn)
			<br>
			Additional interactables such as Cauldrons, Lunar Seers may spawn with this Artifact.<br>

				<b>Artifact of Kith</b><br>
				Artifact of Kin but for interactables<br>
				Each interactable Category will only have 1 thing in it.<br>
				1 Chest, 1 Shrine, 1 Drone, 1 Printer, etc.<br>
				<br>
				Cannot go 2 stages in a row where the Chest is a Lunar or Equipment<br>
				<br>
				Can result in heavily skewed runs and very weird stages.

				Artifact of Kin but for items.<br>
				Only one item, per tier, per stage<br>
				<br>
				Printers and Recyclers are unaffected to allow for some control.<br>
				<br>
				Cannot get repeats of the items for multiple stages.<br>
				Simulacrum rolls a new white and sometimes green after wave 5.<br>
				<br>
				Stages will spawn slightly more loot and printers. Category Chests are removed.<br>
				<br>
				Enemies inventories are unaffected.<br>
				(May not replace all items from modded sources)<br>
				Obviously this artifact would make the game quite a bit more challenging.

### Other Things
Kith and Unison can be a challenge due to being more rng heavy.

Spiriting also lowers damage by up to 25% to counter twice the skills being used twice as fast. (Players and Enemies)

Flamboyance can give you game breaking printers.
