			<b>Artifact of Dissimilarity</b><br>
			Artifact of Dissonance but for interactables.<br>
			Will generate a random set of options based on a list of all interactables.<br>
			<br>
			Most interactable rarities stay the same, but that may change depending on what options are chosen.<br>
			<br>
			Additional interactables such as Cauldrons, Lunar Seers, Void Eradicators may spawn with this Artifact.<br>

				<b>Artifact of Kith</b><br>
				Artifact of Kin but for interactables<br>
				Each interactable Category will only have 1 thing in it.<br>
				1 Chest, 1 Shrine, 1 Drone, 1 Printer, etc.<br>
				<br>
				Cannot go 2 stages in a row where the Chest is a Lunar or Equipment<br>
				<br>
				Can result in heavily skewed runs and very weird stages.

				<b>Artifact of Unison</b><br>
				Artifact of Kin but for items.<br>
				Only one item, per tier, per stage<br>
				<br>
				Printers and Recyclers are unaffected to allow for some control.<br>
				<br>
				Cannot get repeats of the items for multiple stages.<br>
				Simulacrum rolls a new white and sometimes green after wave 5.<br>
				Command will be limited but will often show choices of multiple tiers.<br>
				<br>
				Stages will spawn slightly more loot and printers. Category Chests are removed.<br>
				<br>
				Enemies inventories are unaffected.<br>
				(May not replace all items from modded sources)<br>
				Obviously this artifact would make the game quite a bit more challenging.

				For better control on where to finish the run.

### Other Things
Kith and Unison can be a challenge due to being more rng heavy.

Spiriting also lowers damage by up to 25% to counter twice the skills being used twice as fast. (Players and Enemies)

Lunar Seers will have their destination name in the prompt and ping.

Fixes Treeborn Cannopy and Helminth Roost not being allowed on Random stage order.
