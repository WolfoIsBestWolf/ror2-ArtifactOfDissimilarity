This mod is kind of a high effort joke.

Some of these artifacts are clearly overpowered or unfair.

The artifacts are their own Artifacts indendent of the original at the bottom of the list.

			<td>
				<b>Mirrored Artifact of Swarms</b><br>
				Spawn a clone of every player, but you have half health.<br>
				<br>
				The clone copies your items.<br>
				The clone copies your movements, targeting, skill uses etc.<br>
				The clone teleporters to you if too far away.<br>
				The clone stops moving if you hold down [Interact].<br>
				The clone is considered cloaked and will not be targeted by enemies first.<br>
				If the clone dies, nothing happens.<br>
				The clone and you share movement speed.<br>
				The clone and you share "MultiKills" (Berzerkers)<br>
				<br>
				Some attacks might be blocked if you are too close together, not really anything I can do about it I think.<br>
				For Void Fiend, Void corruptions are synced.<br>			
				For CHEF, Cleavers recalling might be a little jank, as in vanilla CHEF AI can not use Cleavers at all.<br>
				This thing was annoying to network hopefully it works fine.<br>

				<b>Mirrored Artifact of Glass</b><br>
				Items drop an additonal copy, you have 50% health<br>
				<br>
				The health reduction is curse, like normal Artifact of Glass<br>
				Printers cost twice the amount.<br>
				Scrap isnt duplicated<br>
				<br>
				If you find some other infinite loop to get items well yknow oops.<br>

			</td>
			<td>
				<b>Mirrored Artifact of Kin</b><br>
				A family event occurs every stage<br>
				<br>
				The family event tries to be chosen based on the enemies on the stage.<br>
				(Instead of the families set on that stage, else Stage 5 would only ever have Gup family)<br>
				<br>
				With Dissonance any family event could occur on any stage.<br>
				With True Dissonance, it will be a "custom" family of 3 random enemies. (Essentially just Kin x3)<br>
				Shows what enemies are available on the stage like Kin.<br>
				<br>
				The thing multiple people already think Kin is but now real.<br>
				(Suggesting to use LittleGameplayTweaks to add more families but works fine without it.<br>

				Almost exclusively Chests spawn.<br>

				Inverts the Sacrifice Filter.<br>
				Give up Money Shrines, Drones and Printers for many Chests and Shrine of Chance<br<
				Additional exceptions are : Mountain Shrines, Void Seeds, Halcyon Shrines, Gold Altars, Cleansing Pools, Barrels, Radar Scanners, Lemurian Eggs<br>
				Does not lower the amount of interactables per stage.<br>
				<br>
				If used alongside Sacrifice, well only the white-listed interactables spawn.<br>

				<b>Mirrored Artifact of Enigma</b><br>
				Items and equipment have a chance to be of a random tier<br>
				<br>
				10% base chance to replace it. 5% for printers.<br>
				Think Eulogy Zero but any tier.<br>
				Maintains item tag requirements of pools its replacing.<br>
				This could lead to obviously game breaking situations. (Red item in White Printer)<br>
